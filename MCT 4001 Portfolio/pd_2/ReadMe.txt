PD Assignment 2 â€“ MCT 4001
by Kristian Wentzel

No external abstractions needed.

Inspired by classic analog monophonic subtractive
synthesizers. Oscillator goes through AM and FM on
it's way to the LoPass filter. Randomly generated
notes and tempo fluctuations with possibility to
lock patterns. Step sequencer controlling FM.
AD envelopes controlling Filter and Amp. LFO
controlling vibrato (Osc freq) and tremolo (AM).

Try out the presets!

New interface, with the old layout inside a subpatch.
