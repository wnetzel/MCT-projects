Readme file for MCT Team B Sampler

Made by Arvid Falch, Jakob Hoydal, Joseph Clemente, Kristian Wentzel

Our sampler comes with 6 tracks, 2 recordable tracks and 4 tracks in which to load samples. This test version comes with 4 preloaded tracks into the sampler at start. 
The folder samplesISH is part of this zip file and should lie in the same folder as the pd patch when you open the patch. 

Each track has it's own fx control panel. The FX available in the sampler are delay, reverb, distortion, amp mod, ring mod and chorus. 

There's also a recording function at the bottom. Whenever the user has created something interesting he/she/they can hit record and then stop the recording at will, and the result (summed from the master) will be recorded to disk to a file called 
myrecordings.wav. Handy for saving ideas, but overwrites automatically if record is pushed again, so be sure to rename or move the file to another folder if you want to save it for a rainy day. 

The 2 recording tracks: 
Records input from your sound card using adc. 
The scrubber can be used to create effects, or to decide from which position the sample will play from. Each recording track can be looped, or just played using the scrubber. There is also the option to overdub the recorded sample or overwrite it. 
The recorded sample is hardcoded to be 4 seconds, although the ability to change this is in the patch, but we didn't have time for it. 

The 4 pre-loaded sample tracks:
These can be toggled on and off, and there is a function to choose subdivisions. Hitting the subdivisions button will increase the subdivisions one step up to 8 before it resets at 1 again. 
To load your own files into the sampler, simply put files into the folder samplesISH and name them sample1, sample2, sample3 and sample4(and remove the original files).

List of improvements for the portfolio: 
Fixed issues with recording to file
Fixed bug with recording and looping of your own samples
Cleaned up the patch, and made is easier to read
Redid GUI and presentation. 
Improved effects and how they are routed
Fixed minor bugs

Group - we divided up the following four pieces of work; Jakob did the two recorded tracks as scrubbers, Arvid did the preloaded tracks and their subdivision set up, and Joseph did all the FX patches. Kristian was in charge of being able to record the output of the sampler to disk and dealing with randomization. But as mentioned, when we put it together we realized there were a lot of features we wanted that we didn't have. So since three rather small patches got merged early in the process, we have basically worked together in one patch through zoom or physically, and most of what's in the sampler now has been coded in this process, as this was the only way we could really make progress in a sensible way. So it's hard to say who did what, everybody joined in and did their best to have this little sampler work as good as possible by Friday 1600. 

Hope you enjoy it. 

All the best

Arvid, Jakob, Joseph and Kristian
