PD Assignment 4 â€“ MCT 4001
by Kristian Wentzel

Depends on the included 'grain3.pd'.
(It should be okay leaving it where it is.)
The patch also depends on the included 1.wav through 6.wav in the 'sounds' folder.

Be sure that samplerate is set to 44.1 kHz!


This is my take on a playable granular synth.

Which key is triggering what is showed on the right side.
Pre-shipped sounds are selected with 'scroll_sound'.

Try out different samples and density/chance/overlap/size settings
(Pitch/locator/bang can be played with the keyboard)


Suggestions:

1:
* Check the different presets


2:
* Have the autoscroll on
* autoplay_grains off
* Bang samples with space
* Change pitch with a/d and @

3:
* Have autoplay_grains on
* autoscroll off
* Change pitch with a/d and @
* Change location with shift

4:
* Have autoplay_grains on
* autoscroll on
* Try with small chance, density and size settings for percussive triggering

5:
* Have autoscroll off
* autoplay_grains off
* Bang like crazy with the special 'fn'

6:
* Play around with melodic content autoplaying, while having the LFO control the speed.
